# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm, I'm Blake Bishop
### Web Developer/Programmer

I am a Web Developer/Programmer (Full Stack Developer) for the San Diego County Office of Education. For many of our projects within SDCOE, we utilize and leverage the power of C# and .NET Core with ASP.NET Core MVC as our main backend language. For our frontend, we utilize Progress Telerik's Kendo UI for jQuery library to create interactive and dynamic components for our end-users. 

In 2023, I graduated from National University, where I earned my Master of Science in Computer Science. During my time at National, I was exposed to many programming languages, including C++, Java, C#, and PHP. 

While attending National, I also worked full-time as a contractor for Rady Children's Hospital of San Diego in the Genomics department, where I was mentored by the Senior Manager of the development team. During this time, my mentor guided and challenged my full-stack development skills for enterprise-level applications using Flask, Python's web framework, and jQuery for dynamic user interactions with AJAX. 

In July of 2023, I was hired by SDCOE as a Web Developer Programmer. Since then, I have been using C# and .NET Core as my main programming language for the backend. Over the past 2 years at SDCOE, I have pushed myself to try new technologies and improve my overall skills as a web developer. I have created APIs for Push Notifications via Web Push, implemented MFA via TOTP using Twilio's API and NuGet package, Outlook Web Plugins to extend functionality, Azure Maps API for routing, Azure Functions to create serverless functions that run when triggered by an HTTP Request, and finally learned, implemented, and extended Progress Telerik's Kendo UI for jQuery.

I can confidently say that I am a Full-Stack Web Developer who focuses on creating responsive, full-featured web applications for end-users. I am dedicated to being a lifelong learner!

### C# Push Notifications

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) project that I created in my spare time to develop, implement, and test sending Push Notifications to a user's browser via an ASP.NET Core Web Api using the Web Push NuGet Package.

### Azure Functions

This project is a proof-of-concept project that I created in my spare time to develop, implement, and test Azure Functions. This was my first attempt at developing an Azure Function using C# and .NET Core. This repository would be the stepping stone I used to develop another Azure Function that is used in conjunction with an Outlook Web Addin I developed for Red Herring.
